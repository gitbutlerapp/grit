title: Benchmarks
summary: Grit vs Git on realistic workloads, from the committed grit-bench baseline.
---

Performance work is measured on the factory VM and in CI against the **system** `git` binary. Micro-benchmarks live in `grit-lib` (Criterion) and command-level scenarios in `grit-bench` (`grit-utils`).

Command-level numbers below come from the committed **grit-bench** JSON baselines listed in `content/docs/site.toml`. Each scenario runs **hyperfine** against the system **`git`** binary and a release **`grit`** build on the same machine; times are wall-clock milliseconds (mean and spread from timed runs).

## grit-lib: parallel object hashing

Criterion group `hash/batch_parallel` (`cargo bench -p grit-lib --bench objects hash/batch_parallel`) hashes **20 000** Git blob objects of **16 KiB** each using [`hash_objects_parallel`](https://docs.rs/grit-lib/latest/grit_lib/hash/fn.hash_objects_parallel.html) (SHA-1, release build).

| Threads | Time (median) | Throughput |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| 1       | 173 ms        | 1.76 GiB/s |
| 8       | 44.5 ms       | 6.86 GiB/s |

**Speedup (8 vs 1 thread): ~3.9×** on the factory VM (2026-10-07).

Parallel hashing falls back to a serial loop when there are fewer than [`PAR_HASH_MIN_ITEMS`](https://docs.rs/grit-lib/latest/grit_lib/hash/constant.PAR_HASH_MIN_ITEMS.html) (32) objects or less than [`PAR_HASH_MIN_TOTAL_BYTES`](https://docs.rs/grit-lib/latest/grit_lib/hash/constant.PAR_HASH_MIN_TOTAL_BYTES.html) (256 KiB) of payload, so small batches avoid thread overhead.

## grit-bench vs Git

### Methodology

- **Fixtures** use synthetic repos at large file counts and deep history, built deterministically in a scratch directory.
- **Drivers** are CLI invocations of `grit` and `git` with equivalent semantics (not argv-for-argv compatibility).
- **Ratios** are **Grit mean ÷ Git mean**. Values below `1.00×` mean Grit is faster; values above `2.00×` are highlighted as regressions worth investigating.
- **Spread** shows Grit’s standard deviation across timed runs (hyperfine `--min-runs` / warmup settings from the baseline capture).

### Reproduce locally

Build release binaries, install [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine), then run matching grit-bench scenarios from the repo root (see `grit-utils/README.md` for the current subcommands):

```bash
cargo build --release -p grit-cli -p grit-utils

# Example: hot-path scenarios at L/H tiers (switch, pick, merge)
./target/release/grit-bench hot-paths --sizes 10000,100000 --format json --output /tmp/grit-bench-hot-paths.json
```

When roadmap item 2 adds more baseline JSON files on `main`, list their paths under `[benchmarks].baseline` in `content/docs/site.toml` and regenerate the site.

Compare a fresh run against the committed baseline (exit non-zero if any scenario ratio drifts beyond tolerance):

```bash
./target/release/grit-bench compare grit-utils/baselines/hot-paths-before.json /tmp/grit-bench-hot-paths.json --tolerance 0.10
```

### Results

<!-- grit:benchmark-tables -->

To refresh this page after updating a baseline JSON file, regenerate the static site:

```bash
make docs
```

The docs `--check` step fails if baseline numbers change without re-running `make docs`.
